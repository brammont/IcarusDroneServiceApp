    "summary": "Icarus Drone Service Documentation Welcome to the official documentation for Icarus Drone Service, the WPF application that manages drone-servicing jobs (Regular vs. Express), queues them, processes them, and tracks finished jobs. This site is split into two main sections: Docs (this Markdown-based documentation) API (auto-generated from the C# source code via DocFX) You can use the navigation pane on the left to switch between these two sections: Docs → Detailed how-to guides, architectural overview, examples, and diagrams. API → Complete, per-class reference for every public type and member (i.e. your IcarusDrone window class, model classes in Models/, etc.). Quick Start 1. Prerequisites .NET 8.0 SDK (or later) installed DocFX CLI installed (e.g. via Chocolatey: choco install docfx or scoop install docfx) Visual Studio 2022 (or 2019) if you plan to edit/build the WPF application itself Tip: Make sure your WPF project is fully built (and that “XML documentation file” is enabled under Project → Properties → Build) so that DocFX can read your <summary>…</summary> XML comments at metadata time. 2. Project Layout Below is the relevant folder structure. Note that docfx.json, toc.yml, and index.md all live in the root of this repository. Your actual C# project (IcarusDroneServiceApp.csproj) is inside the IcarusDroneServiceApp/ subfolder. IcarusDroneServiceApp\\ ← (Root of documentation repository) │ ├─ docfx.json ← DocFX configuration (already set up) ├─ toc.yml ← Table of contents (links to Docs + API) ├─ index.md ← THIS FILE (your Markdown “homepage”) │ ├─ IcarusDroneServiceApp\\ ← (Your WPF app) │ ├─ IcarusDroneServiceApp.csproj │ ├─ App.xaml │ ├─ IcarusDrone.xaml │ ├─ IcarusDrone.xaml.cs │ └─ Models │ ├─ Drone.cs │ └─ ServiceRepository.cs │ └─ docs\\ (optional) ← Extra Markdown articles or images ├─ articles │ └─ architecture.md └─ images\\"
